# The Shape of Word Embeddings: Quantifying Non-Isometry With Topological Data Analysis
Scripts used for the analysis in a paper
"The Shape of Word Embeddings: Quantifying Non-Isometry With Topological Data Analysis"
by Ond≈ôej Draganov and Steven Skiena.

Most of the code is in Python with shell skripts connecting various Python scripts together.
The final analysis is in a Jupyter Notebook,

The code here is split in three parts:
- A-word_embeddings_to_persistence_diagrams
- B-from_persistence_diagrams_to_language_distances
- C-tree_construction_and_evaluation

Each folder has its own README file with more details.

To run the analysis, follow the numbered files:
- 1-download_word_embeddings.sh
- 2-point_clouds_to_persistence_bars.sh
- 3-compute_language_distances.sh
- 4-construct_and_evaluate_trees.ipynb
- 5-summary_figures.ipynb

The folder structure is set up and empty in the repository.
Contents of the folders with the same names should be copied from one step to the next.
You can also edit the paths in the script to avoid data duplication.
